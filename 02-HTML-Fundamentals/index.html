    <i></i>for Italics or use semantics html as <em>Emphasize text</em>
    <img/> Since image elemnt dont have the content, we dont have end tag, instead have / and it have attributes to display the file(element). 
    <meta charset="UTF-8" /> is a special element with no end tag.

    Regroup elements by putting them in contaners like <header>,<nav>,<article>. All these are simply forms of <div>.They are also semantic html, meaningful

        All modern websites and web applications are built using three
        <i>fundamental</i>
        technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the
        web.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all about,
        and why you too should learn it.
      </p>

      <h3>What is HTML?</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>HTML</strong> stands for
        <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup
        <strong>L</strong>anguage. It's a markup language that web developers
        use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a
        programming language).
      </p>

      <p>
        HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content:
        paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand
        HTML and render HTML code as websites.
      </p>

      <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          The opening tag(Numbering is done automatically, since it is OL.)
        </li>
        <li>The closing tag</li>
        <li>The actual element</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        You can learn more at the
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML"
          target="_blank"
          >MDN Web Docs</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>

      <p>
        There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the
        web. Here are 5 of them:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>To be able to use the fundamental web dev language</li>
        <li>
          To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like
          Worpress or Wix
        </li>
        <li>To build web applications</li>
        <li>To impress friends</li>
        <li>To have fun 😃</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
